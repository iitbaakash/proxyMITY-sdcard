helps teachers create dynamic rich-media lectures.
Porting of ProxyMITY on Aakash Tablet helps users to get access to quality lectures of reputed
teachers, for effective personalized learning. They have the flexibility of studying anytime,
anywhere, and at their own pace. They can also navigate through the topics within the lecture.
They can also play the subtitles with the video for better understanding. Bookmarking feature
helps users to create and update the bookmarks on the videos.
